# 100 Days of Coding Challenge - Projects

Welcome to my 100 Days of Coding Challenge! For the next 100 days, I will be creating and uploading a new project daily using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This challenge aims to improve my skills, foster creativity, and build a diverse portfolio of web development projects.

## Challenge Goals

- **Duration**: 100 Days
- **Daily Projects**: 1 project per day
- **Technologies Used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Project Structure

Each day's project will be organized in its own directory named `DayX_ProjectName` (e.g., `Day1_ResponsiveNavbar`). Each directory will contain:

- `index.html`: The HTML file for the project.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the project.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for adding interactivity to the project.
- `README.md`: A brief description of the project, its features, and any additional notes.

## Daily Log

I will be maintaining a daily log of the projects I create. This log will include the project name, a brief description, and a screenshot or link to the live demo.
