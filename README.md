# 100 Days of Coding Challenge - Projects

Welcome to my 100 Days of Coding Challenge! For the next 100 days, I will be creating and uploading a new project daily using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This challenge aims to improve my skills, foster creativity, and build a diverse portfolio of web development projects.

## Challenge Goals

- **Duration**: 100 Days
- **Daily Projects**: 1 project per day
- **Technologies Used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Project Structure

Each day's project will be organized in its own directory named `100-Days-of-Coding-Projects`. Each directory will contain:

- `Project Name Folder `: According to each day project there will be a project name inside each day project and it will contain following files.
- `index.html`: The HTML file for the project.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the project.
- `main.js`: The JavaScript file for adding interactivity to the project.

## Daily Log

I will be maintaining a daily log of the projects I create. This log will include the project name, a brief description, and a screenshot or link to the live demo.

### Day 1: Tip-Calculator
### Day 2: Calculator
### Day 3: Background-Color-Changer
### Day 4: Counter
